# 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to my profile, a glimpse into my Bachelor of Science journey in Computer Science.

I am a developer focused on **complex logic, system architecture, and gameplay engineering**. You'll find my work here, showcasing my transition from Java-based engine development to C# research prototypes and reverse engineering.

## 🛠️ Code Access & Transparency

To maintain a balance between transparency and licensing requirements:

* **Source Code is Public:** You are welcome to browse the scripts and core logic of my main projects (e.g., **Braid Engine Extension** and **Bombaberti Thesis Framework**).
* **Assets & Binaries are Private:** Due to academic regulations and third-party licensing, the full builds for my university projects are not hosted publicly.

**Looking for a demo?** I am more than happy to provide the full project files and documentation privately upon request. Feel free to reach out! 📧

## 🚀 Current Projects & Roadmap (WIP)

### 1. Gameplay Engineering Hub (C# / Unity / Reverse Engineering)
My active development focus where I bridge theory and practice.
* **Kalista Mod (RoR2):** Analyzing game logic via **dnSpy** to reimplement complex movement mechanics.
* **Boss Design:** Learning the end-to-end pipeline (Blender/Unity) to create 3D encounters using **State Machines**.
* **Goal:** Reimagining "hard-but-fair" mechanics in 3D environments.

## 🏛️ Previous Projects & Academic Work

### 1. Braid-inspired Rewind Engine (Java / libGDX)
*My proudest technical achievement.* A time-manipulation system requiring deep state-management and architectural refactoring for FPS-independent stability.
**Currently not available due to licensing issues - WIP** 

### 2. Game Jam Project (Java / libGDX) - [Playable Build Available]
A fast-paced development exercise focusing on rapid prototyping and game feel. 
* **Note:** Source code is private, but you can [Play the game here](https://schwertknappe.itch.io/bertis-factory-escape).

### 3. Bombaberti: CA Research Framework (C# / Unity)
My Bachelor's Thesis project. It explores procedural environment generation through Cellular Automata and marks my rapid adaptation to the C# / Unity ecosystem.

### 4. University Seminar Projects - [Not Public / Archive]
Various implementations covering software patterns, algorithms, and simulation basics.
