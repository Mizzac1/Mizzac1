# 👋 Hello there!

Welcome to my profile, a glimpse into my Bachelor of Science journey in Computer Science.

I'm focused on complex logic, system architecture, and game development. You'll find my key projects here, sorted by my proudest work! ✨

## 🔒 A Quick Note on Access to my projects.

The repositories for my main university projects (like the **Braid Software Project** and my **Bachelor's Thesis**) contain the necessary structure and documentation for clarity.

Due to academic regulations and licensing requirements, the **full project is not public**.

**However:** I'm more than happy to provide all project files and programs privately upon request during the application process. Feel free to reach out! 📧
